This repository contains the scripts used for my bachelor thesis. It is created for being able to work from different 
computers and sharing code with other members of the team, not for distributing the scripts. 

Contact me at joar.nykvist@gmail.com if you wish to use any of the scripts. 

The NatNet SDK provided by Optitrack is property of Optitrack Incorporated and I give no directions for 
how it can be distributed. It is free to download at the Optitrack website.
